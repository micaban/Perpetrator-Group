# Terrorist Organization Identification
This work treats the application of a deep learning approach for the association between attacks and perpetrator groups, which is often unknown. Identifying the most involved actors helps extract inherited features and better study attacks to implement suitable countermeasures and predict feature events. Starting from the well-known resource related to anti-terrorism operations, Global Terrorism Database (GTD), we build a knowledge graph (KG) representing entities and relationships involved
in terrorist attacks. Subsequently, we adopted the KG to train a graph neural network (GNN) to identify terrorist organizations from events using the inductive link prediction technique. The experimentation, conducted by adopting the HinSAGE framework, demonstrates promising performance in terms of accuracy with a discrete
improvement to state-of-the-art.
